# AlevelProject
This is my Alevel OCR Computer Sceince coursework on checking if a rhythm is correct, by taking user input by the notes and the playing of the user.
The code should then check if it is correct.

This code makes use of the orchestra library, which is in the project. The link to the repository of the orchestra OMR library is https://github.com/AbdallahHemdan/Orchestra.
